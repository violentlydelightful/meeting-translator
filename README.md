# Meeting Translator

What they said → What they meant.

A decoder ring for corporate speak. Paste what your coworker said in the meeting, find out what they actually meant.

## Examples

| They Said | They Meant |
|-----------|------------|
| "Let's circle back" | "I'm ignoring this for now" |
| "Per my last email" | "I already told you this, can you read?" |
| "That's a great question" | "I don't know the answer" |
| "I don't have the bandwidth" | "This is not my problem" |
| "With all due respect" | "I'm about to be disrespectful" |
| "Noted" | "Your input has been acknowledged and discarded" |
| "Let's take this offline" | "You're embarrassing yourself and I'm giving you an exit" |

## The Phrase Database

The translator recognizes phrases like:
- "Synergy" → "I have no idea what I'm talking about"
- "Quick sync" → "A meeting that will not be quick"
- "Happy to help" → "I am not happy about this"
- "Interesting" → "I completely disagree"
- "I'll try" → "I will not try"
- "Going forward" → "Let's all collectively agree to amnesia"

## Why This Exists

Because after your 47th meeting where someone said "let's align on the strategic synergies," you start to wonder if words have meaning anymore.

They do. Just not the meaning you think.

## Contributing

Know a corporate phrase we missed? The void is always hungry for more bureaucratic speak.
